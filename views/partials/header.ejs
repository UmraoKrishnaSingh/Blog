        <!-- added a space before  Blog and used a psuedo element before on navbar-brand with content "Dev".
        I tried to add a space after Dev but html was not reading space as the last character apparently. I 
        could've just used a span element to achieve what I did but I wanted some practice with pseudo elements

          <li onclick= "location.href = '/contact'" id="contact"><a href="/contact">CONTACT</a></li>
          <!-- onclick here is used to convert the entire li into a button you can press to load the
          respective route otherwise only the anchor links would've led to the pages and the way I have
          made navigation links to look like button, it becomes very counter intuitive if the whole button
          doesn't work. It feels as if the button is bugged. There is probably a better way to do this but
          for now I've done it in this particular way. Too lazy to change nav links into button. 
          window.location.href is js way to redirect to a page. There is also location.replace which works
          a little different but I'm not sure what the difference is. What I can tell is that at a place you
          can use one or the other method.  -->
